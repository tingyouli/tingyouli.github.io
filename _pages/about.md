I am currently a Year 1 PhD student in Electronic Engineering in Chinese University of Hong Kong(CUHK).Prior to this, I received bachelor's degree(Rank top 5%) in BSc Data Science from City University of Hong Kong(CityU). During undergraduate study, I was fortunate to work as reasearch assistants for [Prof.LI Jizhou](http://jizhou.li)(PhD Supervisor)and [Prof.LI Xinyue](https://www.xli-lab.com/)(CityU). With Prof.LI Jizhou, my reasearch still mainly focuses on Fourier phase retrieval with deep learning and other topics related to AI for Science. With Prof.LI Xinyue, I mainly focused on using statiscal models to help predict various diseases.
