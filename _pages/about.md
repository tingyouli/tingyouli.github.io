I am currently a Year 1 PhD student in Electronic Engineering in The Chinese University of Hong Kong( CUHK ) . Prior to this, I received bachelor's degree( Rank top 5% ) in BSc Data Science from City University of Hong Kong( CityU ) . During undergraduate study, I was fortunate to work as reasearch assistants for [ Prof. LI Jizhou ]( http://jizhou.li ) ( Now PhD supervisor ) and [ Prof. LI Xinyue ]( https://www.xli-lab.com/ ) ( CityU ) . With Prof. LI Jizhou, my reasearch still mainly focuses on Fourier phase retrieval with deep learning and other topics related to AI for Science. With Prof. LI Xinyue, I used to focus on using statiscal models to help predict various diseases among elders.
